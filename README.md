# Pre-MSc-Marketing-Thesis-Data-Wrangling

I did my thesis by means of a between-subjects experimental design with two tasks using the online survey tool Qualtrics (N = 188).
One group was triggered to rely on their feelings whilst the other was conditioned to rely on logic and reasoning throughout these experiments.

The first task required participants to determine whether or not they saw a pattern for a series of twelve pictures on a scale from 1 to 9.
The mean score for all pictures in which no pattern was present is to be aggregated and compared across the experimental groups.

The second task required participants to come up with as many associations as possible for two common household objects within a timeframe of 2 minutes.
For the experiment, the contents of these answers didn't matter so much as the number of answers per individual. 

I used Jupyterlabs to prepare the data for analyses in SPSS.
